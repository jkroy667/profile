1. What are the traditional methods of message transfer? How is Kafka better from them?
    * Traditional methods of message transfer include message queues (like RabbitMQ) and publish-subscribe systems (like JMS). 
      These systems often have limitations in scalability, fault tolerance, and handling large volumes of real-time data.
    * Kafka is better because it offers:
        * Scalability through partitioning and replication across multiple brokers.
        * Fault tolerance by replicating data across nodes.
        * High throughput for handling large amounts of data with low latency.
        * Durability with persistent storage.
        * Decoupling of producers and consumers allowing consumers to read messages at their own pace.

2. What are the major components of Kafka?
    * The major components of Kafka are:
        * Producer: Publishes messages to topics.
        * Consumer: Subscribes to topics and processes messages.
        * Broker: Stores and manages messages in partitions.
        * Topic: A category to which records are sent.
        * Partition: A division of a topic for parallel processing.
        * ZooKeeper: Manages metadata and coordinates the Kafka cluster. (Note: Being replaced by KRaft in newer versions).

3. What do you mean by a Partition in Kafka?
    * A partition in Kafka is a subdivision of a topic that stores an ordered sequence of records. Partitions allow Kafka to distribute data across multiple brokers, enabling parallel processing and scalability.
    * Each partition is identified by an offset, which helps consumers keep track of the messages they have read.

4. What do you mean by zookeeper in Kafka and what are its uses?
    * ZooKeeper in Kafka is a centralized service used for managing metadata, coordinating brokers, and tracking the status of nodes in a Kafka cluster.
    * It helps with leader election for partitions, managing configurations, and maintaining information about topics, brokers, and consumer groups, ensuring the reliability and high availability of the Kafka cluster.

5. Can we use Kafka without Zookeeper? 
    * Kafka can now be used without ZooKeeper as of version 2.8. The release of Kafka 2.8.0 in April 2021 gave us all the opportunity to try it out without ZooKeeper.
    * However, this version is not yet ready for production and lacks some key features.

6. Explain the concept of Leader and Follower in Kafka.
    * Leader: Handles all read and write requests for a partition. It is the primary replica.
    * Followers: Replicate data from the leader to ensure data redundancy. If the leader fails, one of the followers is promoted to become the new leader. This ensures high availability.

7. Why is Topic Replication important in Kafka? What do you mean by ISR in Kafka?
    * Topic replication in Kafka ensures data durability and high availability by storing multiple copies of a partition across different brokers. If a broker fails, replicas on other brokers ensure that data is not lost and remain accessible.
    * ISR (In-Sync Replicas) are replicas that are fully synchronized with the leader. They are up-to-date with the latest data and can be promoted to leader if the current leader fails, ensuring reliability in data replication.

8. What do you understand about a consumer group in Kafka?
    * A consumer group in Kafka is a group of consumers that work together to read data from a topic.
    * Each message in a partition is consumed by only one consumer in the group, allowing for load balancing.
    * Multiple consumer groups can read the same data independently, enabling different applications to process data concurrently.
