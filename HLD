Estimate twitter QPS(query per second) and storage requirements Tips,
1. Rounding and Approximation.
2. Write down your assumptions
3. Label unit like 5MB or 5GB

Rate Limiter 
1. Request block:                                                          2 post per sec, create 10 accounts per day per IP, claim reward no more than 2 time a week from same device.
2. Prevent resource starvation:                                            prevents DOS attacks, by blocking the excess calls. Twitter limits 300 per 3 hour.
3. Reduce Cost:                                                            important when use third party APIs,
4. Prevent server overloading
5. Client-side rare limiter or server-side rare limiter.
6. High fault tolerance:                                                    if any problems, not affect the entire system. 
7. Rate limiter middleware:                                                 place in the middle of client and the API server. Use cache(Redis) to store bucket info
8. Status code 429:                                                         too many request
9. Types of bucket we need:                                                 per API 1 bucket, per IP bucket or global bucket.
10. Token bucket:                                                           token are filled per minute like 4 tokens per min. Per request takes 1 token to execute. problem  with burst of request.
11. Leaking bucket:                                                         request are stored in queue and processed on regular intervals. Problem with burst of old request
12. Fixed window counter:                                                   divides timeline into fixed time window and assign a counter. Problem of burst of request at the edges.
13. Sliding window log algorithm:                                           maintains a timestamp of request.
14. Sliding window counter algorithm:                                       combination of fixed window and sliding window log.
15. Race condition:                                                         highly concurrent environment. Mutex or locks should be used.
16. Synchronisation issue:                                                  When using multiple rate limiter synchronisation is required. Solution use sticky session. Not advisable because of scalability issue, better solution use centralised data store like redis.

Consisting Hashing
1. Horizontal Scaling
2. Rehashing problem:                    hash(key) % N, N is number of servers, well when size of pool is fixed and data distribution is even, fails when pool updates
3. Cache Miss when pool update:          consisting Hashing solves the problem 
4. Definition:                           Consistent hashing is a special kind of hashing such that when a hash table is re-sized and consistent hashing is used, only k/n keys need to be remapped on average, k = keys, & n= slots
5. Hashing functions:                    SHA-1
6. Hash servers:                         can map based on server’s IP address 
7. Hash Keys:                            different from what used in reshaping problem.
8. Server lookup:                        go clockwise from key position on the ring until a server is found.
9. Add  or remove server:                small fraction of keys need to be redistributed.
10. Issues with it:                      partitions are not uniform, can be very small or fairly large therefore non uniform distribution of keys.
11. Virtual Nodes:                       Kind of solves the issue, virtually represent a server in the ring, by again hash the server. In real world system, number of virtual node is much larger.
12. Standard deviation:                  As no. of virtual node increases standard deviation of keys distribution to servers become small.

Key-Value Store (NOSQL database)
1. Single-Server Key value store:                         store key-value in hash tables, in memory, fitting everything in memory impossible, optimisation, data compression & frequent data. No made for big data store
2. CAP theorem:                                           impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide more than two of these guarantees.
    1. Consistency:                                       consistency means all clients see the same data 
    2. Availability:                                      availability means any client which requests data gets a response even if some of the nodes are down. 
    3. Partition Tolerance:                               a partition indicates a communication break between two nodes. Partition tolerance means the system continues to operate despite network partitions. 
3. Distributed key-value store:                           also known distributed hash tables,
    1. CP (Consistency and partition tolerance) system:   if any one node unavailable, block all writes ops, all system down, Banks 
    2. AP (Availability and partition tolerance) system:  Keep accept read & write while a node down, data synced later when Network partition resolved.
4. Data Partition:                                        distribute data into multiple server, two challenge, distribute data evenly and minimise data movement when node add or remove, consisting hashing can be used here.
5. Data replication:  
    1. High availability and reliability:                 replicated data asynchronously over N servers
    2. Issue when Virtual Nodes:                          N nodes in the ring may owned by fewer than N servers, that’s why avoid storing data in same data centres, store replica in distinct data centre.
6. Consistency:                                           data replicated multiple nodes, need to sync, quorum can guarantee consistency for both read and write.
    1. Quorum:
        1. There is a coordinator that manages, there is N replicas
        2. Write quorum of size W, write ops considered success if ack from W replicas.
        3. Read quorum of size R, read ops considered success if ack from at least R replicas.
        4. Configuration N,W,R typical tradeoff between latency and consistency.
        5. R=1 and W = N, the system is optimised for a fast read. 
        6. W=1 and R = N, the system is optimised for fast write. 
        7. W + R > N, strong consistency is guaranteed, at least one overlapping node that maintains latest data. 
        8. W + R <= N, strong consistency is not guaranteed. 
    2. Strong Consistency:                                forcing a replica not to accept new reads/writes until every replica has agreed on current write, not suitable for highly available system.
    3. Weak Consistency:                                  subsequent read operations may not see the most updated value. 
    4. Eventual Consistency:                              this is a specific form of weak consistency. Given enough time, all updates are propagated, and all replicas are consistent.  Dynamo and Cassandra adopt eventual consistency, which is our recommended consistency model for our key-value store. 
    5. Inconsistency Resolution:                          versioning
        1. Replication gives high availability but causes inconsistencies among replicas. Versioning and vector locks are used to solve inconsistency problems 
        2. Vector Locks:    A vector clock is a [server, version] pair associated with a data item 
7. Handling Failures:
    1. Gossip Protocol:                                   Each node has member id and heartbeat counter, periodically increment the counter, and sends this to random nodes and that updates the membership list, if heartbeat not inc within predefined period, considered offline.
8. Handling temporary failures:                           use sloppy quorum.
9. System Architecture:
    1. Client comm. with key-value store through APIs, get(key), put(key, value)
    2. A coordinator is a node acts as a proxy between client and key-value store.
    3. Nodes are distributed on the ring using consistent hashing.
    4. The system is decentralised so adding removing nodes become automatic.
    5. Data is replicated multiple nodes, no single point of failure.
10. Write path:                                           (based on the Architecture of Cassandra)
    1. Write request is persisted on a commit log file.
    2. Data is saved in memory cache, when cache is full or reached to a threshold, data is fused into SS Tables( sorted-string table), sorted list of key-value pairs.
11. Read Path
    1. Checks first data is in memory cache, return directly 
    2. If not, check in bloom filters to figure out which SSTables and then return its value.
12. Summary
	1. Ability to store big data:                             use consistent hashing to spread the load across multiple servers.
	2. High availability reads:                               Data replication, multi data-centre setup.
	3. High available writes:                                 versioning and conflict resolution with vector clocks
	4. Dataset partition:                                     consistent Hashing 
	5. Incremental Scalability:                               consistent Hashing.
	6. Heterogeneity:                                         consistent Hashing.
	7. Tunable Consistency:                                   quorum consensus.
	8. Handling temporary failures:                           sloppy quorum and hinted handoff
	9. Handling permanent failures:                           Merkle tree
	10. Handling data centre outage:                          cross data-centre replication.


Unique ID generator:
1. Multi-master replication		  increase it by k, k = no. of databases, hard to scale also not possible if server cnt updates. IDs don;t go up to time.
2. Universally unique identifier (UUID)   128bit, don't go up based on time, alpha numeric number, large space to store.
3. Ticket server            		  centralized auto_increment feature in a single database server. easy to implement and scale but single point of failure.
4. Twitter snowflake 			  sign bit(1) + timestamp (41)epoch time(69 years) + datacenterID (5) + MachineID (5) + Sequence number (12). Best for distributed networks.

URL Shortner
1. URL redirecting 		when you enter a tinyurl onto the browser. Once the server receives a tinyurl request, it changes the short URL to the long URL with 301 redirect.
2. API endpoints:  		URL shortening:= POST api/v1/data/shorten, URL redirecting:= GET api/v1/shortUrl.
3. 301 Vs 302 redirect 		permanently redirected therefore browser caches and reduces load as only 1st request go | temporaraly as request first send to shortening server then redirected better when track click rate.
4. Hash Maps			stored in url shorting server: <short Url, Long url>
5. URL Shortening 		long url -----> hash  = https://tinyUrl/{hashValue}.
6. Methods to shorten URL:
	1. Hash + collision Resolver:	hash the url ---> take first 7 letters of it ---> check in database (optimise use bloom filters) ---> if exits add predifined string and again hash if not save in db.
	2. Base 62 conversion:		convert base 10 to base 62 ----> 11157 = 2 * 62(2) + 55 * 62(1) + 59 * 62(0) = 2TX
					long url -----> is present in db ----> generate ID -----> use base 62 to generate short url ---- > store id,shortUrl,LongUrl.
7. Store it in cache.


Web Crawler
1. Uses of crawler: 		Search engine indexing, web archiving, web mining, web monitoring.
2. requirements:
	1. Scalability: 		parallelization
	2. Robustness: 			Handle Bad HTML, unresponsive servers,
	3. Polintness: 			not make too many requests to a website within a short time interval.
	4. Extensibility		minimal change required to add feature.
3. High Level Design:			seed url --> URL frontier(stores url to be downloaded) --> HTML downloader --> DNS resolve and content parse --> content seen --> content storage or link extractor
					--> URL filter --> URL seen ? --> URL storage or URL frontier.
4. DFS vs BFS: 				consider as directed graph, dfs not used because can be very deep and can be impolite as searching same host only, so bfs is preferred.
5. Politeness: 				when too much request to same host. Delay can be added between two download tasks.
					mapping table --> queue router --> multiple queue(each for each server) --> queue selector --> worker threads.
6. Priority: 				prioritize urls based on usefulness, pageranks, website traffic or update frequency.
					A prioritizer can be placed in front of queues that computes priority of url and and assign high priority value queue.
7. Storage for frontier: 		Hybrid, urls stored in disk, and maintain buffers for enque/dequeue data operations.
8. HTML downloader performace inc.	
	1. distributed crawl: 		multiple severs download html
	2. Cache DNS resolve
	3. Locality: 			distribute servers over geographically 
	4. short timeout		some servers responds very late so a wait time is applied.
9. Detect and avoid problematic content
	1. Redundant content
	2. Spider traps
	3. Data noise.
10. Server-side rendering 		If we download and parse the website then cannot get dynamically generated links so server side nessasary.

Notification Sysytem
1. Different types
	1.IOS push Notification: 	Provider --> APNs(Apple push notification) --> ios devices(client)
	2.Android push Notification: 	provider --> FCM(firebase cloud messageing) --> Android devices 
	3.SMS message: 			provider --> sms message --> sms
	4.Email: 			provider --> email server --> email.
2. User Contact save: 			To send notif we need phone number, token or email address so when user installs app we store these info.
3. Components for high-level-view
	1. server 1 to N: 		sends notif via APIs of notification server.
	2. Notification server: 	provide apis, carry validations, query database or cache, put notif data to the queue.
	3. cache: 			userInfo, device Info etc.
	4. DB: 				All data 
	5. message queue: 		remove dependency between components, also acts as a buffer doring burst of notif sends
	6. workers: 			pull notif from queues and push to the correspoinding third party service.
	7. third party server		sends notif to the user.
4. Will recipients receive a notification exactly once?
	No, due to its distributed network, can solve by checking eventID of message already send or not 
5. retry mechanism: 			when third party server fails to send notif, it will be send to queue for retry.
