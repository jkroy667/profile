* What is the main purpose of an operating system? Discuss different types?
    The main purpose of operating system is to act as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user, managing hardware resources, providing user interface and enabling execution of 
    applications. the OS ensures fair use of resources(CPU,RAM,Storage etc), manages file system, handles I/O, ensures security and stablity.
    * Types of OS 
        1) Batch OS:
            process batches of jobs without user interaction, ideal for repeititive task. eg Early IBM system
        2) Time Sharing OS:
            Allows multiple users to interact with the computer simultaneously. Provides each user with a small time slice for CPU usage. eg UNIX
        3) Distributed OS:
            manages a group of distinct computer and make them appear as a single system. Enables resource sharing and improved performance accross a network. eg Amoeba, LOCUS.
        4) Network OS:
            Provides networking capabilities to manage data, users, and security over a network. eg Windows Server,
        5) Real-Time OS:
            Process data in real-time, with strict time constraints, Used for applications where time-critical response is essential. eg VxWorks
        6) Mobile OS:
            Designed specially for mobile devices. Optimizes performance, battery life, and user experience for mobile platforms. eg Android, iOS.

* What is a socket, kernel and monolithic kernel ? 
    * Socket:
        A socket is an endpoint for sending or recieving message over a network.
        Sockets allow application to communicate with each other using standard protocol like TCP or UDP.
        Messaging Apps use sockets, particularly TCP or WebSockets, to facilitate real-time communication, ensuring that messages are delivered quickly and reliably between users.
    * Kernel:
        It is the core component of an operating system that manages system resource and communication between hardware and software.
        It handles task such as process management, memory management, device management, and system calls.
    * Monolithic kernel:
        A monolithic kernel is a type of kernel architecture where the entire operating system runs in a single kernel space, including device drivers, file system management, and system calls.
        Provides good performance but lots of lines of code. e.g, Unix, Linux.

* Difference between process and program and thread? Different types of process ? 
    * Program:
        A program is a set if instruction written in a programming language that is stored in a disk.
        eg. a C file example.c or a executable file example.exe
    * Process:
        process is an instance of a program. When execute a program it becomes a process which performs all the tasks meantioned in the program.
        eg. When you open a browser (e.g., chrome.exe), an instance of the program is created as a process.
    * Thread:
        A thread is a smallest unit of execution in a process.It is also called a lightweight process. The idea is to divide the process into multiple process to achieve parallelism.
        eg. Word processor uses multiple threads: one thread to format the text, another thread to 

* Define virtual memory, thrashing, threads.
    * virtual memory:
        It is a memory management technique used by the operating system to provide an "isllusion" of a large, contiguous block of memory to programs, even the physical memory(RAM) is smaller.
        It used combination of RAM and disk storage(HDD or SDD) to extend the apparent avialable memory.
        When a program needs more memory than is physically available, parts of data that are not immediately needed is swapped out to disk. and the required data is loaded to the RAM.
        Provides isolation between processes, enhancing security and stability.
    * thrashing:
        It is a situation when system is spending a major portion of its time in serving page faults. But the actual processing is done very low.
        High degree of multiprogramming (if number of process keeps on increasing in the memory), if a process is allocated too few frames, then there will too frequent page faults. causing thrashing
        if a computer has too many applications open with high memory demands, it may start thrashing as the operating system continuously swaps data between RAM and disk.

* What is RAID ? Different types ?
    Redundant array of independent disk is a technique which makes use of combination of multiple disk instead of using a single disk to increase performance, data redunduncy or both.
    It distributes data across the disks in various ways, depending on the RAID level, providing different balances of speed, storage capacity, and fault tolerance.
    Types of RAID:
        * RAID 0 (Striping):
            Data is split across multiple disks. high performance because of parallel read and write but no redunduncy.
            If one disk fails all data is lost.
        * RAID 1 (Mirroring):
            Data is duolicated across multiple disks. High data reliablity; redunduncy.
            Uses twiced the storage capacity.
        * RAID 10 (striping + mirroring)
            Combines RAID 1 and RAID 0 (mirroring and striping). High performance and fault tolerance.
        * RAID 3 (striping with single parity):
            Data is striped with parity information stored in a single disk, so that if one striped disk fail can retreive its data from parity.
            Slow writes as parity also need to be update in case of update so parity disk acts a bottleneck here as lot of throughput to handle.
        * RAID 5 (striping with distributed parity)
            Data is striped with parity information distributed among disks. Good balance of performance, storage, and fault tolerance.
            Can recover from only one disk failure.
        * RAID 6 (striping with double parity)
            Similar to RAID 5 but with double parity. Can survive up to two disk failures. 
            Slower write performance.
        * RAID 50 and RAID 60:
            Combine multiple RAID 5 or RAID 6 arrays with RAID 0.

* What is a deadlock? Different conditions to achieve a deadlock. 
    It is a situation in multi-process system where two or more process not able to procced because each is holding a resource that the other one holds.
    Conditions of deadlock:
        A deadlock occurs when the following four conditions are met simultaneously:
        * Mutual exclusion:
            Only one process can use resource at a time. If another process request for the resource it should wait.
        * Hold and wait:
            A process must be holding atleast one resource and simultaneously waiting for additional resources that are currently held by the other processes.
        * No preemption:
            Resources cannot be forcebly taken from the process holding them; they must be released voluntarily by the holding process after completion of the task.
        * Circular wait:
            A circular chain of processes exists, where each process holds at least one resource needed by the next process in the chain. 
            For example, Process A is waiting for a resource held by Process B, Process B is waiting for a resource held by Process C, and Process C is waiting for a resource held by Process A.
    A deadlock occurs when these four conditions coexist in a system. Managing deadlocks typically involves prevention, detection, or recovery strategies to avoid deadlock.

* What is fragmentation? Types of fragmentation. 
    Fragmentation is the inefficient use of memory or storage, where free space is divided into small, unusable pieces, affecting system performance.
    Types of fragmentation:
        Internal fragmentation:
            Occurs when fixed-sized memory blocks are allocated, and the memory requested by the process is smaller than the allocated block size. 
            The unused space within the allocated block is wasted.
        External fragmentation:
            Happens when free memory is scattered in small, non-contiguous blocks across the system.
            Even though there may be enough total free memory to satisfy a request, the memory is not contiguous, preventing allocation

* What is spooling ?
    Simulataneous peripheral operations online is a process where data is stored in a buffer (usually in a disk) to be processed or send to the peripheral devices like printer or any I/O devices.
    Purpose of Spooling:
        Improves performance: Allows CPU to continue working while peripheral device process data stored in disk.
        Manages Device Access: Coordinates access to slower devices shared by multiple users or processes.
        Prevents Blocking: Enables multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously without waiting for one device to finish.
    example: Print Spooling: When multiple print jobs are sent to a printer, they are stored in a spool (a buffer area on the disk). 
    The printer processes each job sequentially from the spool while the CPU continues other tasks without waiting for the printer to complete.

* What is semaphore and mutex ? differentiate also Define Binary semaphore.
    Semaphore:
        A synchronization tool that uses a counter to access the shared content.
        Types:
            Counting Semaphore: Allows multiple threads to access resources up to a set limit.
            Binary Semaphore: Functions like a mutex, allowing only one thread to access a resource at a time.
    Mutex:
        A locking mechanism that ensures only one thread can access a resource at a time.
        The thread that locks the mutex must be the one to unlock it.

* Define Belady’s Anomaly ?
    Belady’s Anomaly is a situation where increasing the number of page frames in memory can actually lead to an increase in the number of page faults
    when using the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) page replacement algorithm.
    * Solution to fix Belady’s Anomaly:
        Implementing alternative page replacement algo helps eliminate Belady’s Anomaly.. Use of stack based algorithms, such as Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm 
        and Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm, can eliminate the issue of increased page faults as these algorithms assign priority to pages

* what are Starving and Aging in OS ?
    Starvation:
        A situation where a process is contineously denied nessasary resources because other processes are always given priority.
        Can occur in scheduling systems where high-priority tasks preempt lower-priority ones.
    Aging:
        A technique used to prevent starvation by gradually increasing the priority of processes that have been waiting for a long time.
        Ensure long waiting process get a chance to execute.
    starvation is the indefinite delay of processes, while aging is a method to prevent it by boosting the priority of waiting processes over time.
