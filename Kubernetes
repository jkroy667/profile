13. How do rolling updates work in a Deployment?
     * In a Deployment, rolling updates gradually replace old pods with new ones to minimize downtime.
     * Kubernetes creates new pods with the updated configuration while keeping a specified number of old pods running.
     * Once the new pods are ready and healthy, the old pods are terminated, ensuring a smooth transition without service interruption.

14. What is a Namespace in Kubernetes? 
     * A Namespace in Kubernetes is a logical partitioning of the cluster that allows for grouping and isolating resources.
     * It enables multiple users or teams to share the same cluster while keeping their resources, such as pods, services, and deployments, organized and separated.

15. Explain the use of Labels and Selectors in Kubernetes.
     * Labels in Kubernetes are key-value pairs attached to objects (like pods) that provide metadata for organizing and selecting resources
     * Selectors are used to filter and identify sets of resources based on these labels, enabling operations such as grouping, management, and service targeting.

16. What is PV and PVC in kubernetes ?
     * A Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes is a storage resource that provides persistent storage independent of pod lifecycle. 
     * A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a user's request for storage, specifying size and access modes, which binds to a matching PV to allow pods to use that storage.

17. Explain the differences between a DaemonSet and a ReplicaSet.
     * A DaemonSet ensures that a copy of a pod runs on all (or specific) nodes in a Kubernetes cluster, typically used for background tasks like logging or monitoring.
     * A ReplicaSet ensures a specified number of identical pod replicas are running at all times, primarily used for scaling and maintaining application availability.

18. How can you achieve communication between Pods in different Nodes?
     * Pods in a cluster of k8s can speak to one another by default use the internal IP addresses. The underlying container runtime or network plugin gives a virtual network overlay to this communication.

27. How does Kubernetes manage storage orchestration?
    * Kubernetes manages storage orchestration through Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs). PVs are storage resources in the cluster, while PVCs are requests for storage by users.

28. Explain the concept of Taints and Tolerations in Kubernetes.
    * Taints and Tolerations in Kubernetes are used to control which pods can be scheduled on specific nodes.
        * Taints are applied to nodes to mark them as unsuitable for certain pods, effectively repelling them.
        * Tolerations are added to pods to allow them to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints.

29. Describe the use of init containers in Kubernetes.
    * Init containers in Kubernetes run before the main application containers in a pod.
    * They perform setup tasks, such as initializing data or waiting for services, ensuring that the main containers start only when necessary conditions are met.

30. In Kubernetes, what are the various services available?
    * ClusterIP: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP, accessible only within the cluster.
    * NodePort: Exposes the service on each node’s IP at a static port, allowing external access.
    * LoadBalancer: Creates an external load balancer (if supported by the cloud provider) to expose the service.
    * ExternalName: Maps a service to the DNS name of an external service, enabling service discovery.

31. explain the concept of a Custom Operator in Kubernetes.
    * Operators in Kubernetes use the Kubernetes API to automate tasks like deploying applications, scaling them up or down, and managing their overall health.
    * They act like custom tools that add new features to Kubernetes, making it easier to handle complex applications.
    * Operators are usually set up as custom controllers, which help keep everything running smoothly by defining how resources should be managed.
