* What is the main purpose of an operating system? Discuss different types?
    The main purpose of operating system is to act as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user, managing hardware resources, providing user interface and enabling execution of 
    applications. the OS ensures fair use of resources(CPU,RAM,Storage etc), manages file system, handles I/O, ensures security and stablity.
    * Types of OS 
        1) Batch OS:
            process batches of jobs without user interaction, ideal for repeititive task. eg Early IBM system
        2) Time Sharing OS:
            Allows multiple users to interact with the computer simultaneously. Provides each user with a small time slice for CPU usage. eg UNIX
        3) Distributed OS:
            manages a group of distinct computer and make them appear as a single system. Enables resource sharing and improved performance accross a network. eg Amoeba, LOCUS.
        4) Network OS:
            Provides networking capabilities to manage data, users, and security over a network. eg Windows Server,
        5) Real-Time OS:
            Process data in real-time, with strict time constraints, Used for applications where time-critical response is essential. eg VxWorks
        6) Mobile OS:
            Designed specially for mobile devices. Optimizes performance, battery life, and user experience for mobile platforms. eg Android, iOS.

* What is a socket, kernel and monolithic kernel ? 
    * Socket:
        A socket is an endpoint for sending or recieving message over a network.
        Sockets allow application to communicate with each other using standard protocol like TCP or UDP.
        Messaging Apps use sockets, particularly TCP or WebSockets, to facilitate real-time communication, ensuring that messages are delivered quickly and reliably between users.
    * Kernel:
        It is the core component of an operating system that manages system resource and communication between hardware and software.
        It handles task such as process management, memory management, device management, and system calls.
    * Monolithic kernel:
        A monolithic kernel is a type of kernel architecture where the entire operating system runs in a single kernel space, including device drivers, file system management, and system calls.
        Provides good performance but lots of lines of code. e.g, Unix, Linux.
