* Define network 
    A network is a group of interconnected devices that communicate to share resources and data.
    It includes hardware (like routers and cables) and software (like protocols) to facilitate this communication.
    Network can range from small (LAN) to large (WAN) and Internet, which connects devices globally.

* What do you mean by network topology, and explain types of them ?
    Network topology refers to the arrangement of devices in a network and how they are connected.
    Types of Network topology:
      * Bus Topology: Device share a single central cable. Simple but if the cable fails, the network goes down.
      * Star Topology: Device connected to a central hub. Reliable, but failure of the hub affects all.
      * Ring Topology: Devices form a close loop. Fast data transmission, but one failure can disrupt the network
      * Mesh Topology: Every device connects to every other device. Very reliable but costly and complex.
      * Tree Topology: Hierarchical structure combining stars and bus. Scalable but can be affected by central bus failure.
      * Hybrid Topology: Mix of different topologies, flexible but complex to design.
    Each topology has its own use cases, depending on the needs for reliability, cost, and scalability.
