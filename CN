* Define network 
    A network is a group of interconnected devices that communicate to share resources and data.
    It includes hardware (like routers and cables) and software (like protocols) to facilitate this communication.
    Network can range from small (LAN) to large (WAN) and Internet, which connects devices globally.

* What do you mean by network topology, and explain types of them ?
    Network topology refers to the arrangement of devices in a network and how they are connected.
    Types of Network topology:
      * Bus Topology: Device share a single central cable. Simple but if the cable fails, the network goes down.
      * Star Topology: Device connected to a central hub. Reliable, but failure of the hub affects all.
      * Ring Topology: Devices form a close loop. Fast data transmission, but one failure can disrupt the network
      * Mesh Topology: Every device connects to every other device. Very reliable but costly and complex.
      * Tree Topology: Hierarchical structure combining stars and bus. Scalable but can be affected by central bus failure.
      * Hybrid Topology: Mix of different topologies, flexible but complex to design.
    Each topology has its own use cases, depending on the needs for reliability, cost, and scalability.

* Define bandwidth, node and link ? 
    * Bandwidth: It refers to the maximum rate of data transfer across a network or internet connection. It is measured in bytes per second and indicates the capacity of connection to transmit data.
    * Node: A node is any device or point in a network that can send, receive, or forward information. Examples include computers, servers, routers, or any other connected device.
    * Link: A link is the physical or logical connection between two nodes in a network. It can be a wired connection (like cables) or wireless connection(radio,waves), enabling communication between devices.

* Explain TCP model.
    The TCP/IP model is a four-layer framework that governs how the data is transmitted over the internet.
    Layers:
        Application Layer: Handles communication between applications (e.g., HTTP for web browsing, SMTP for email).
        Transport Layer: Ensures reliable data transfer between devices. TCP for reliable, ordered delivery; UDP for faster, less reliable delivery.
        Internet Layer: Routes data accross the networks using IP address (responsible for packet addressing and routing).
        Network Access Layer: Manages the physical transmission of data over the network (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

* explain Layers of OSI model.
    The OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection) is a seven-layer framework that standardizes communication functions in a network.
    Layers of the OSI Model:
        * Physical Layer: Deals with the physical connection between devices, including cables, switches, and signal transmission.
        * Data Link Layer: Ensures error-free data transfer between two connected nodes using MAC addresses. It organizes data into frames.
        * Network Layer: Handles routing and forwarding of data between networks, using logical addresses like IP addresses.
        * Transport Layer: Ensures reliable data transfer with flow control and error correction (e.g., TCP, UDP).
        * Session Layer: Manages and controls connections between devices, establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions.
        * Presentation Layer: Translates data into a format that the application layer can understand, handling data encryption and compression.
        * Application Layer: Provides network services to end-users and applications (e.g., email, web browsers, FTP).
    Each layer performs a specific role, ensuring smooth communication across networks.

* what is the significance of Data Link Layer.
    The Data Link Layer is the second layer of the OSI model and ensures reliable data transfer between directly connected devices.
        * Error Detection & Correction: Identifies and sometimes corrects errors during transmission.
        * Framing: Organizes raw data into frames for easy transmission.
        * Flow Control: Manages data flow to prevent overload between sender and receiver.
        * MAC Addressing: Uses MAC addresses to ensure data is sent to the correct device on a local network.
        * Access Control: Controls device access to the communication medium, preventing collisions.
    the Data Link Layer ensures organized, error-free data transmission between devices on the same network.

* Define gateway, difference between gateway and router ?
    A node that is connected to two or more networks is commonly known as a gateway. It is also known as a router. It is used to forward messages from one network to another.
    Both the gateway and router regulate the traffic in the network. 
    Differences between gateway and router: A router sends the data between two similar networks using same protocol while gateway sends the data between two dissimilar networks using different protocols.

* What does ping command do ? 
    A Ping commands checks the network connectivity between different devices. It sends data packet to a target and wait for its response, helping check if the device is reachable and measuring the round-trip time.
    In short, ping is used for diagnosing network connection issues.

* What is DNS, DNS forwarder and NIC ?
    * DNS:
        A DNS translates human-readable domains like (www.example.com) into IP addresses (192.168.1.1) that computer use to identify each other in a network.
        Without DNS, users must know the IP address of the web page that you wanted to access.
    * DNS forwader:
        It is a server that forwards DNS queries to an external DNS server (often on the internet) when it doesn;t know the answer.
        It also reduces lookups by caching the responses.
    * NIC (Network interface card):
        A NIC is a hardware component that allows a computer to connect to a network. It provides the physical interface for sending and receiving data.
        Every NIC has its own MAC address that identifies the PC on the network.

* data flow through my local pc.
    PC → Sends request to router using local IP.
    Router → Uses NAT to convert local IP to public IP.
    Router → Forwards request to the internet (public network).
    Internet → Returns data to the router (public IP).
    Router → Translates public IP back to PC's local IP and forwards the data.

* What is NAT (Network Address translator) and how it works ?
    NAT is a method used by routers to map private IP addresses used within a local network to a single public IP address (or a few public IP addresses) when accessing external networks like the internet.
    It allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address, improving security and saving IPv4 addresses.
    whats the flow
        Your laptop (IP: 192.168.1.2) sends a request to visit www.example.com.
        The router changes the source IP of the request to its public IP (e.g., 203.0.113.5).
        The website responds to the router’s public IP.
        The router then translates the public IP back to your laptop’s private IP (192.168.1.2) and forwards the data.

* What is MAC address ?
    A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.
    Your laptop sends a message to another device on your network. It uses the device’s MAC address to ensure the message is delivered to the right device at the local level,
    while IP addresses handle routing outside the network. Switches use MAC addresses to forward frames to the correct device within a network.

* What is IP address, private IP address, public IP address, APIPA ? 
    An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol,"
    which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.
    IPv4: 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
    IPv6: 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)
    * Private IP Address:
        A Private IP address is used within local networks (like home or office networks) and cannot be accessed directly from the internet. 
        If you want to access the internet on these private IPs, you must use a proxy server or NAT server.
    * Public IP Address:
        A Public IP address is assigned by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and is unique across the entire internet.
        Devices with public IPs can be accessed directly over the internet.
        Websites, servers, and routers that connect directly to the internet have public IP addresses.
    * APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing):
        APIPA is a feature used by devices when DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) fails to assign an IP address.
        It automatically assigns a self-generated IP in the range 169.254.0.0 – 169.254.255.255, allowing basic network connectivity within the local network but without internet access

* Difference between IPv4 and IPv6 
    Address Length: IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1), while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses (e.g., 2001:0db8::7334).
    Address Space: IPv4 supports around 4.3 billion addresses, whereas IPv6 has a virtually unlimited supply (340 undecillion).
    IPv4 often requires manual configuration or DHCP, while IPv6 supports automatic address configuration (SLAAC).

* What is Subnet ?
    A subnet (short for subnetwork) is a smaller network created by dividing a larger network into multiple segments. Subnets help organize and manage a network more efficiently.
    They improve performance and security by reducing the size of broadcast domains and controlling traffic within smaller network segments.
    Each subnet has its own range of IP addresses, defined by a subnet mask (e.g., 255.255.255.0 for a /24 subnet).

* what are firewalls ?
    Firewalls are security devices or software that control network traffic based on predefined rules to protect a network or device.
    They act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, like the internet, to prevent unauthorized access and threats.
    Traffic Filtering: Determines which data packets are allowed or blocked.
    Protection: Shields networks from unauthorized access and cyber threats.
    Types: Include network firewalls (protect entire networks) and host-based firewalls (protect individual devices).

* what are different type of delays ?
    The delays, here, means the time for which the processing of a particular packet takes place.
    * Propagation Delay:
        Time taken for a signal to travel from the source to the destination. Depends on the distance between devices and the speed of the transmission medium
    * Transmission Delay:
        Time required to push all the packet’s bits into the link. Determined by the packet size and the link's bandwidth
    * Processing Delay:
        Time taken by routers or switches to process packet headers and make routing decisions.
    * Queuing Delay:
        Time a packet spends waiting in a queue before it can be transmitted.
    These delays collectively contribute to the overall latency experienced in network communications.

* what is 3 way handshaking ?
    Three-way Handshake is a process used in TCP to establish a reliable connection between client and a server before data transmission begins. It ensures both parties are ready for communication
    and agrees on initial parameters.
    Steps of Three-Way Handshaking:
        * SYN (Synchronize): The client sends a SYN packet to the server to initiate a connection and inform the server of its initial sequence number.
        * SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge): The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, acknowledging the client's SYN request and sending its own SYN packet with a sequence number.
        * ACK (Acknowledge): The client sends an ACK packet back to the server, acknowledging the server’s SYN-ACK packet.
    After these steps, a connection is established, and data can be transmitted. It allows you to transfer multiple TCP socket connections in both directions at the same time.

* difference between API gateway, reverse proxy and load balancer 
    API gateway:
        Function: Manages and routes API requests, handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and logging. It provides a single entry point for all API requests.
        Use Case: Used to aggregate multiple microservices, handle API versioning, and manage API traffic and security.
    Reverse Proxy:
        Function: Sits between clients and servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate server and returning responses. It can also handle SSL termination and caching.
        Use Case: Used to hide server details, balance loads, and provide additional security features like SSL encryption.
    Load Balancer:
        Function: Distributes incoming network or application traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overloaded, improving performance and reliability.
        Use Case: Used to ensure high availability and reliability by distributing client requests evenly among a pool of servers.

* What is RSA algorithm ?
    RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key
    A client (for example browser) sends its public key to the server and requests for some data. The server encrypts the data using the client's public key and sends the encrypted data.
    Client receives this data and decrypts it. Since this is asymmetric, nobody else except the browser can decrypt the data even if a third party has the public key of the browser.

* What is HTTP and HTTPS protocol ? 
    HTTP is the HyperText Transfer Protocol which defines the set of rules and standards on how the information can be transmitted on the World Wide Web (WWW).
    It helps the web browsers and web servers for communication. It is a ‘stateless protocol’ where each command is independent with respect to the previous command.
    HTTP is an application layer protocol built upon the TCP. It uses port 80 by default. HTTPS is the HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure or Secure HTTP. 
    It is an advanced and a secured version of HTTP. On top of HTTP, SSL/TLS protocol is used to provide security.
    It enables secure transactions by encrypting the communication and also helps identify network servers securely. It uses port 443 by default.

* What is SMTP protocol ? 
    SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a standard protocol used for sending emails across the Internet. It is responsible for the transmission of emails from a client (email sender) to a mail server
    Client to Server: The email client (like Gmail or Outlook) sends the email to the SMTP server. 
    Server to Server: The SMTP server forwards the email to the recipient's email server.
    Server to Client: The recipient retrieves the email using protocols like POP3 or IMAP.
    SMTP is not used for receiving emails but strictly for sending, ensuring efficient communication between email servers.

* TCP and UDP protocol, prepare differences ?
    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are both transport layer protocols used for data transmission over networks, but they differ in functionality and use cases.
    TCP:
        Connection-Oriented: Establishes a connection between sender and receiver before data transmission (three-way handshake).
        Reliable: Ensures that data packets are delivered in order, with error checking and retransmission if packets are lost.
        Use-Case: Used in applications where accuracy and reliability are critical, like web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), file transfer (FTP), and email (SMTP).
        it is because it provides flow control and acknowledgment of data
    UDP:
        Connectionless: No connection is established before data transmission; packets are sent directly.
        Unreliable: Does not guarantee the delivery of packets or ensure the order of arrival, with no retransmission for lost packets.
        Suitable for applications where speed is important and minor data loss is acceptable, such as video streaming, online gaming, or VoIP.
        UDP has only the basic error checking mechanism using checksums.

* what is checkSum ?
    In UDP (User Datagram Protocol), a checksum is a simple mechanism used for error detection. It verifies whether the data in a packet has been altered during transmission.
    The sender calculates a checksum by adding the values of the packet's data, and stores this in the UDP header.
    The packet, along with the checksum, is sent to the receiver.
    The receiver recalculates the checksum. If it matches the one in the header, the data is assumed to be intact. If not, the packet is discarded.

* What happens when you enter “google.com” (very very famous question) 
    Caching Check: Before making a request, the browser checks if a cached version of the website exists. If valid, it uses the cached data to load the page faster. If not, the process continues.
    DNS Resolution: The domain "google.com" is translated into an IP address using DNS (Domain Name System). This could also be cached from previous visits, speeding up the process.
    TCP Connection: The browser establishes a connection with Google's server via a 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
    HTTP/HTTPS Request: The browser sends a request to the server for the webpage. If using HTTPS, an SSL/TLS handshake ensures a secure connection.
    Server Response: The server processes the request and sends back resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images). These resources can be cached by the browser or a CDN to improve future load times.
    Rendering the Page: The browser renders the page, applying styles, scripts, and content to display the webpage to the user.
    Subsequent Caching: The browser may store certain resources in its cache for future requests, reducing load times when revisiting the site.

* Hubs Vs Switches
    Hubs:
        A hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a network.
        It broadcasts data to all devices connected, leading to potential data collisions.
    Switches:
        A switch is more advanced and directs data only to the intended device based on MAC addresses.
        Reduces data collisions and improves network efficiency.

* explain VPN, advantages and disadvantages of it 
    A VPN creates a secure, encrypted connection over a public network (like the internet) to protect data transmission and ensure privacy.
    Advantages:
        Security: Encrypts data to protect it from unauthorized access.
        Privacy: Masks the user's IP address, hiding their location and identity online.
        Access: Allows users to access restricted or region-blocked content by bypassing geo-restrictions.
    Disadvantages:
        Slower speeds: Encryption and rerouting through servers can reduce internet speed.
        Trust issues: Users must trust the VPN provider not to log or misuse their data.
        Potential legal concerns: Using VPNs to bypass restrictions can lead to legal consequences in some regions.

* What are LANs ?
    A local area network (LAN) is a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home.
    A LAN can be small or large, ranging from a home network with one user to an enterprise network with thousands of users and devices in an office or school.
