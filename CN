* What is the main purpose of an operating system? Discuss different types?
    The main purpose of operating system is to act as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user, managing hardware resources, providing user interface and enabling execution of 
    applications. the OS ensures fair use of resources(CPU,RAM,Storage etc), manages file system, handles I/O, ensures security and stablity.
    * Types of OS 
        1) Batch OS:
            process batches of jobs without user interaction, ideal for repeititive task. eg Early IBM system
        2) Time Sharing OS:
            Allows multiple users to interact with the computer simultaneously. Provides each user with a small time slice for CPU usage. eg UNIX
        3) Distributed OS:
            manages a group of distinct computer and make them appear as a single system. Enables resource sharing and improved performance accross a network. eg Amoeba, LOCUS.
        4) Network OS:
            Provides networking capabilities to manage data, users, and security over a network. eg Windows Server,
        5) Real-Time OS:
            Process data in real-time, with strict time constraints, Used for applications where time-critical response is essential. eg VxWorks
        6) Mobile OS:
            Designed specially for mobile devices. Optimizes performance, battery life, and user experience for mobile platforms. eg Android, iOS.
