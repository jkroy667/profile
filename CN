* Define network 
    A network is a group of interconnected devices that communicate to share resources and data.
    It includes hardware (like routers and cables) and software (like protocols) to facilitate this communication.
    Network can range from small (LAN) to large (WAN) and Internet, which connects devices globally.

* What do you mean by network topology, and explain types of them ?
    Network topology refers to the arrangement of devices in a network and how they are connected.
    Types of Network topology:
      * Bus Topology: Device share a single central cable. Simple but if the cable fails, the network goes down.
      * Star Topology: Device connected to a central hub. Reliable, but failure of the hub affects all.
      * Ring Topology: Devices form a close loop. Fast data transmission, but one failure can disrupt the network
      * Mesh Topology: Every device connects to every other device. Very reliable but costly and complex.
      * Tree Topology: Hierarchical structure combining stars and bus. Scalable but can be affected by central bus failure.
      * Hybrid Topology: Mix of different topologies, flexible but complex to design.
    Each topology has its own use cases, depending on the needs for reliability, cost, and scalability.

* Define bandwidth, node and link ? 
    * Bandwidth: It refers to the maximum rate of data transfer across a network or internet connection. It is measured in bytes per second and indicates the capacity of connection to transmit data.
    * Node: A node is any device or point in a network that can send, receive, or forward information. Examples include computers, servers, routers, or any other connected device.
    * Link: A link is the physical or logical connection between two nodes in a network. It can be a wired connection (like cables) or wireless connection(radio,waves), enabling communication between devices.

* Explain TCP model.
    The TCP/IP model is a four-layer framework that governs how the data is transmitted over the internet.
    Layers:
        Application Layer: Handles communication between applications (e.g., HTTP for web browsing, SMTP for email).
        Transport Layer: Ensures reliable data transfer between devices. TCP for reliable, ordered delivery; UDP for faster, less reliable delivery.
        Internet Layer: Routes data accross the networks using IP address (responsible for packet addressing and routing).
        Network Access Layer: Manages the physical transmission of data over the network (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

* explain Layers of OSI model.
    The OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection) is a seven-layer framework that standardizes communication functions in a network.
    Layers of the OSI Model:
        * Physical Layer: Deals with the physical connection between devices, including cables, switches, and signal transmission.
        * Data Link Layer: Ensures error-free data transfer between two connected nodes using MAC addresses. It organizes data into frames.
        * Network Layer: Handles routing and forwarding of data between networks, using logical addresses like IP addresses.
        * Transport Layer: Ensures reliable data transfer with flow control and error correction (e.g., TCP, UDP).
        * Session Layer: Manages and controls connections between devices, establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions.
        * Presentation Layer: Translates data into a format that the application layer can understand, handling data encryption and compression.
        * Application Layer: Provides network services to end-users and applications (e.g., email, web browsers, FTP).
    Each layer performs a specific role, ensuring smooth communication across networks.

* what is the significance of Data Link Layer.
    The Data Link Layer is the second layer of the OSI model and ensures reliable data transfer between directly connected devices.
        * Error Detection & Correction: Identifies and sometimes corrects errors during transmission.
        * Framing: Organizes raw data into frames for easy transmission.
        * Flow Control: Manages data flow to prevent overload between sender and receiver.
        * MAC Addressing: Uses MAC addresses to ensure data is sent to the correct device on a local network.
        * Access Control: Controls device access to the communication medium, preventing collisions.
    the Data Link Layer ensures organized, error-free data transmission between devices on the same network.

* Define gateway, difference between gateway and router ?
    A node that is connected to two or more networks is commonly known as a gateway. It is also known as a router. It is used to forward messages from one network to another.
    Both the gateway and router regulate the traffic in the network. 
    Differences between gateway and router: A router sends the data between two similar networks while gateway sends the data between two dissimilar networks.
